## [Project 1: Credit Risk Modeling](https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Credit_Risk_Modeling)

## Overview
This project aims to measure the credit risk of LendingClub, (an American peer-to-peer lending company), by calculating the expected loss of their outstanding loans. Credit risk is the likelihood that a borrower would not repay their loan to the lender. By continually evaluating the risk and adjusting their credit policies, the lender could minimize its credit losses while it reaches the fullest potential to maximize revenues on loan borrowing. It is also crucial for the lender to abide by regulations that require them to conduct their business with sufficient capital adequacy, which, if in low, will risk the stability of the economic system.

The key metric of credit risk is Expected Loss (EL), calculated by multiplying the results across three models: PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default). The project includes all three models to help reach the final goal of credit risk measurement.

## [Project 2: Customer Analytics](https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Customer%20Analytics)

## Overview
This project aims to support a retail or FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) company to formulate marketing and pricing strategies that could maximize revenues on each brand of candy bars. To reach the fullest potential of bringing up revenues, a company should find the 'sweet spot' for price to maximize three customer behaviours: purchase probability, brand choice probability, and purchase quantity. 

Data from customer purchase history were used for training the regression models to predict those three customer behaviours in a preconceived price range. The results were then converted into price elasticities so that we can examine the effects of changing price on each of the behaviours. Hence, we will be able to find the suitable marketing and pricing strategies.

To better position our products, we will firstly perform segmentation on our customers to support our analysis on customer behaviours, allowing us to customize marketing strategies for customers with different backgrounds.

## [Project 3: Absenteeism](https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Absenteeism)

## Overview
This project is a part of the PortfolioProjects repository by barkamoljon and focuses on predicting absenteeism at work using machine learning algorithms. The project uses the "Absenteeism at work" dataset and the goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the probability of an employee being absent from work.

* __Python Version__: 3.9.6
* __Packages__: pandas, numpy, and sklearn
* __Algorithms__: regression(logistic, linear), BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, metrics
* __Dataset Source__: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barkamolurinboev/absenteeism

## [Project 4: Tableau Portfolio Project SQL Queries](https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Tableau%20Portfolio%20Project%20SQL%20Queries.sql)

## Overview
The Tableau Portfolio Project is a collection of SQL queries and Tableau dashboards that explore a dataset of customer orders for a fictitious company. The dataset includes information on customer orders, products, and sales, and the goal of this project is to provide insights into the company's sales and customer behavior.

The SQL queries are used to prepare the data for analysis, and the results are then visualized in Tableau dashboards. The dashboards provide an interactive way to explore the data and to discover insights into the company's sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

The project demonstrates skills and knowledge in SQL, data cleaning and preparation, data analysis, and data visualization using Tableau. By exploring the data and creating interactive dashboards, this project provides valuable insights into the company's sales and customer behavior, which could be used to inform business decisions and strategies.

## Requirements
* __Microsoft SQL Server Version__: 18.12.1
* __Packages__: tableau, microsoft sql
* __Algorithms__: sql queries
* __Dataset Source__: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barkamolurinboev/airbnb-listings-2016


## [Project 5: COVID Portfolio Project](https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project%20-%20Data%20Exploration.sql)

## Overview
The project is titled "COVID Portfolio Project - Data Exploration" and the code is written in SQL language. The main objective of the project is to explore and analyze COVID-19 data using various SQL queries and visualizations.

The project begins with importing COVID-19 data into a SQL database, followed by data cleaning and pre-processing. Then, the author uses various SQL queries to answer questions related to COVID-19, such as:

- What is the total number of confirmed cases and deaths in each country?
- How has the number of cases and deaths changed over time?
- What are the top 10 countries with the highest number of cases and deaths?
- How has the spread of COVID-19 varied by continent?

The author also uses SQL to create visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to help better understand the data.

Overall, the project provides a good example of how SQL can be used to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data, and may be useful for anyone interested in data exploration or epidemiology.

## Requirements
* __Microsoft SQL Server Version__: 18.12.1
