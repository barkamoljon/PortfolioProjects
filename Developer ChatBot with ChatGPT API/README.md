Title: Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API Documentation

Introduction:
The Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API is a python-based project that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 API to create a ChatBot capable of having conversations with developers. The ChatBot is designed to answer coding and software development related questions posed by developers in natural language.

Installation:
To install this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from this link: https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Developer%20ChatBot%20with%20ChatGPT%20API/Developer%20ChatBot%20with%20ChatGPT%20API.ipynb
2. Install the required libraries listed below:
    a. OpenAI
    b. requests
    c. json

Usage:
After installation, open the "Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API.ipynb" file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or run the project in any Python IDE. 

The ChatBot can be initiated by running the "response" function in the code. The function takes a user query as input and returns the response from the ChatBot.

Examples:
Here are some examples of how the ChatBot can be used:

1. User Query: Can you recommend a good Python Framework for web development?
   ChatBot Response: Django is one of the most popular frameworks for web development in Python.

2. User Query: How do I implement a binary search algorithm in Java?
   ChatBot Response: Here is an example implementation of binary search in Java:
   
                        public static int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
                            if (right >= left) {
                                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                                if (arr[mid] == x)
                                    return mid;
                                if (arr[mid] > x)
                                    return binarySearch(arr, left, mid - 1, x);
                                return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, right, x);
                            }
                            return -1;
                        }

3. User Query: How do I connect to a MySQL database using PHP?
   ChatBot Response: Here is an example code snippet for connecting to a MySQL database using PHP:

                        $servername = "localhost";
                        $username = "username";
                        $password = "password";
                        $database = "dbname";

                        // Create connection
                        $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $database);

Conclusion:
The Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API is a useful tool for developers looking for quick answers to coding and software development related questions. It utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 API to provide natural language responses to user queries. The project can be easily installed and used in any Python environment.
