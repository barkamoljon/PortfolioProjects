# Absenteeism Project

## Overview
This project is a part of the PortfolioProjects repository by barkamoljon and focuses on predicting absenteeism at work using machine learning algorithms. The project uses the "Absenteeism at work" dataset and the goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the probability of an employee being absent from work.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.6
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn libraries

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. Navigate to the Absenteeism project directory using the following command:
3. Install the required libraries using the following command:
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

## File Descriptions
The project consists of the following files:
1. `Absenteeism_at_work.csv`: This file contains the dataset used for the project.
2. `Absenteeism_Project.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for the project.


## Project Details
The project is divided into the following sections:
1. Data Loading and Exploration: In this section, the dataset is loaded and explored to understand the structure and nature of the data.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: In this section, the data is cleaned and prepared for modeling.
3. Model Development: In this section, various machine learning algorithms are used to build a model that can accurately predict the probability of an employee being absent from work.
4. Model Evaluation: In this section, the performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting absenteeism at work using machine learning algorithms. The project showcases the ability to clean and prepare data, build models, and evaluate their performance. The code and documentation in this repository can be used as a reference for similar projects or as a starting point for further development.
